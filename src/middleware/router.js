  Here is a custom middleware function we use to listen to all redux actions,

  If the router location change action is dispatched we check to see if the pathname contains
  /increase or /decrease and dispatch corresponding counter actions should either case exists.

  Finally we call next(), which is the next function in the middleware chain and return its value to be
  used further along the middleware chain!
